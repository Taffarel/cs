# CodeSheriff

CodeSheriff is a code quality tool mainly developed by Dafiti Brazil for PHP
projects.

## How it works

CodeSheriff compares two git branches and gives stats about its quality
using tools like PHPMD, PHPCS and PHPUnit for code code coverage.

CodeSheriff can work with CI tools like Jenkins and validate quality of code
before it goes live or a branch is merged into master.
